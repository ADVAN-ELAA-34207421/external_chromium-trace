The things in the www subdirectory were forked from the Chrome tracing tool.
This should end up getting merged upstream at some point into either the
Chromium code base or else a separate shared project.

The update.sh script should be used to package the CSS and Javascript files in
the www directory into the style.css and script.js files.  These files are
being checked in, and get embedded in each trace HTML file the systrace.py
generates.  Each time a file in the www directory gets updated, this script
will need to be rerun, and the generated files must be committed along with the
changes to the www directory.
